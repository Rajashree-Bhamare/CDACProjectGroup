Hi, Rajashree Bhamare here !

GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.
It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

GitHub's interface is easy enough to help individuals manage other projects, such as journals. 
Also, anybody can sign up and host a GitHub public code repository at no cost.
That is why GitHub is especially popular with open-source projects.
