Requirement:
The majority of once-manual systems have been replaced by automated and computerised ones 
in this new age of computers. As a result, we are creating the web-based application "Online 
Green Market Place" for the online sale of green items like fruits and vegetables in order to 
model the current system and eliminate its flaws. This project investigates how online web 
applications can be utilised to address consumer and supplier issues while simultaneously giving 
young people a chance to find jobs.

Online Green Market Place is a web-based application. The application's goal is to simplify and 
automate the process of buying green products such as fruits and vegetables. 
The app's attempts to bring suppliers (farmers who create the items) and customers (buyers who 
buy the products) together on a platform where suppliers can display their products and 
consumers may buy them. 
This application streamlines the efforts of both suppliers and customers, as the supplier can focus 
solely on cultivation and listing his or her products on the platform, and customers can make 
purchases directly through the collaborative platform, eliminating the need for the supplier to 
worry about sales. 
The website enables customers to order fresh and high-quality green items directly from the farm 
to his doorstep. A customer can make a purchase from the comfort of his own home, saving both 
time and effort. 
The application intends to eliminate middlemen (mediators/dealers), reducing product delivery 
time and cost
